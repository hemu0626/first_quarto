## Environment Setup

I know nothing about the dynamic behind, but I successfully set it up. I will introduce the procedure. I completely agree with Dr. Gruber at his post [@gruber2022] :

> I never really found an IDE that I liked. I tried a few different ones including Spyder and Jupyter Notebook (not technically an IDE) and compared to RStudio and R Markdown they felt rather limited. Most Python users I met seem to think IDEs are not really important, which confuses me even further. That’s what you look at the entire time while programming!

Once you got familiar with Rstudio, or anyway Posit IDE, you are spoiled, that is how I felt. Therefore, I decide to continue to teach and code in Rstudio, even with python or jupyter-note. I also use Zotero for reference and Typora for slides writing.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
py_install('pandas')
py_install('matplotlib')
py_install('numpy')
py_install('jupyter')
py_install('scikit-learn')
reticulate::repl_python()
#virtualenv_install('matplotlib')
#os <- import("os")
#os$listdir(".")
#use_python("/opt/homebrew/bin/python3")
py_install('scikit-survival')
```
